# multiple-regression
Multiple regression is an extension of simple linear regression. 
It is used when we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables. 
The variable we want to predict is called the dependent variable (or sometimes, the outcome, target or criterion variable).
One of these two matlab code files is to create a multiple regression function, and the other one is to show an example to use this function with independent variable x.mat and dependent variable y.mat.
